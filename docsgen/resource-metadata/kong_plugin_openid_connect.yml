  A resource for the Kong Enterprise plugin [`openid-connect`](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/).
  Due to the complexity of the plugin, only a subset of the functionality is currently exposed; for example, it cannot be configured as a relying party.
example: |
  resource "kong_plugin_openid_connect" "oidc-route" {
    route_id = "${kong_route.mock.id}"
    auth_methods = ["bearer"]
    issuer = "https://oidc.example.com/auth/"
  }
import: |
  Existing plugins can be imported: `terraform import kong_plugin_openid_connect <plugin UUID>`
