# request-transformer-advanced

This is a no-op plugin for testing the `kong_plugin_request_transformer_advanced` resource.

The plugin schema is derived from Kong's open source `request-transformer` plugin, with additional fields that appear in the [documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/0.33-x/plugins/request-transformer/) for the `request-transformer-advanced` plugin.
Kong's Apache 2.0 license is included, since this is technically a derivative work.
